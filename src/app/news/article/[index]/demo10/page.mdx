Ruby Nodes is proud to have played a key role as a testnet partner for zkVerify, the pioneering decentralized verification layer designed for ultra-fast, cost-efficient proof verification in blockchain, AI, and data environments.

Throughout the testnet phase, Ruby Nodes contributed its proven technical expertise and globally distributed infrastructure to help stabilize the network and ensure a seamless transition to mainnet.

Now live, zkVerify provides the backbone for scalable, millisecond-fast proof validation across a variety of applications—from blockchains and AI systems to gaming and identity solutions.

Ruby Nodes remains part of zkVerify's validator set, delivering reliable, high-performance validation while continuing to lower barriers for participants through a retail-first approach.

## **What is zkVerify?**

zkVerify is creating the foundational infrastructure for scalable trust through zero-knowledge proof verification. It offers millisecond-fast, universally compatible verification services that cut costs and boost performance for blockchains, AI applications, and digital ecosystems requiring cryptographic assurance.

Designed as a high-performance, modular, and secure blockchain, zkVerify underpins next-generation Web3 innovations by specializing in efficient proof verification and settlement.

## **Ruby Nodes’ Validator Role**

Ruby Nodes operates a globally distributed, resilient hardware infrastructure supporting 30+ blockchains, offering comprehensive services from validators and L2 sequencers to RPC servers and bridge relayers. Joining zkVerify’s initial validator set, Ruby Nodes strengthens the network’s Proof-of-Stake consensus with reliable, high-performance validation, ensuring security and decentralization.

Our retail-first philosophy lowers participation barriers, making it easier for individual stakers to contribute to zkVerify’s network security alongside institutions—aligning closely with zkVerify’s mission to foster broad, decentralized ecosystem engagement.

## **Partnership Highlights**

**- Validator reliability:** Ruby Nodes’ robust operations and infrastructure have strengthened zkVerify’s Proof-of-Stake network from testnet through the mainnet launch.

**- Retail-first staking:** By empowering everyday users to participate and earn, Ruby Nodes supports a highly decentralized ecosystem for proof verification.

## **Recent Milestone & Roadmap Highlights**

zkVerify successfully launched its mainnet and native VFY token just days ago. The platform now offers full EVM compatibility, seamless bridging, and ready-to-use verifiers such as UltraHonk, Halo2 families, and EZKL paths.

Alongside an expanding validator set, ongoing community quests continue to drive adoption and innovation across AI, gaming, and digital identity sectors. zkVerify is already positioning itself as essential shared infrastructure where scalable and cost-effective proof verification is critical.
