The wait is over, Walrus mainnet is officially live. After months of rigorous testing and optimization, the decentralized storage network built on Sui is now ready for real-world use. This launch represents a major leap forward in scalable, cost-efficient, and tamper-proof data storage. But Walrus isn't just another storage solution—it's a paradigm shift, offering blobs, programmable storage, and onchain verification for AI datasets, DeFi, RWA, and media storage.

## **Why Walrus Matters?**

The decentralized storage landscape has long faced challenges—high costs, slow retrieval speeds, and complex integration. Walrus addresses these issues head-on, and with infrastructure providers like Ruby Nodes, the network is set up for scalability and resilience from day one.

From AI-driven applications to high-speed financial data and media archiving, Walrus mainnet opens the doors for a new generation of trustless, cost-efficient, and verifiable storage solutions. Users and developers alike can trust in the integrity and performance of the network from the very beginning.

But in very simple terms, Walrus is a next-gen decentralized storage network, that makes a lot of new cool stuff possible.

## **Ruby Nodes as a Genesis Validator & Storage Node Operator on Walrus**

By leveraging our high-performance infrastructure, Ruby Nodes started validating transactions, securing the blockchain, and maintaining network integrity from the genesis block.

Beyond validation, we are also an active storage node operator, contributing to the decentralized and censorship-resistant storage layer of Walrus.

## **How to Stake WAL with Ruby Nodes**

Want to stake your WAL with a community validator? Here’s how in 4 easy steps:
1. Visit [https://stake-wal.wal.app](https://stake-wal.wal.app)
2. Find **Ruby Nodes** storage node

That’s it! Secure Walrus and earn rewards with us!

## **The Road Ahead: Mass Adoption**

With the mainnet launch and the WAL token TGE, Walrus is entering the next phase of its evolution. Projects are already building on Walrus, expanding its use cases across various industries:

**Storage** – Tusky

**Media** – Decrypt, One Comics, FanTV

**DeFi & NFTs** – TradePort

**AI & Data** – Plume, Linera, Ika, Atoma

The future of decentralized storage is here. And it's being built on Walrus, powered by pioneers like Ruby Nodes.
