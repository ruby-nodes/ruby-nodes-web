Ika mainnet has officially launched, and Ruby Nodes is proud to be among the initial validators powering this revolutionary blockchain interoperability network.

Ika is the first sub-second Multi-Party Computation (MPC) network designed for unmatched scalability and zero-trust security, capable of scaling to 10,000 signatures per second across hundreds of nodes. By integrating seamlessly with the Sui blockchain, Ika fundamentally redefines cross-chain asset control and decentralized custody, opening new frontiers in Web3.

## **Why Ika is a Game-Changer**

Traditional blockchain ecosystems are fragmented, relying heavily on bridges and wrapped tokens that introduce risks and inefficiencies.

Ika replaces these with a universal coordination layer enabling smart contracts on Sui to natively control Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other assets without intermediaries.

This zero-trust architecture combines cryptographic breakthroughs in 2PC-MPC that deliver ultra-fast transaction throughput with sub-second latency, addressing major pain points in scalability, security, and decentralization. With over $2 trillion of assets poised for native interoperability, Ika empowers real-time cross-chain DeFi, programmable custody, and institutional-grade digital asset management.

## **Ruby Nodes’ Role as an Ika Validator**

As a genesis validator, Ruby Nodes contributes to securing Ika’s decentralized network by validating and signing transactions while maintaining network performance at scale.

Our high-availability infrastructure supports the hundreds of operator nodes ensuring robust, censorship-resistant coordination for the network. Participating as a validator in Ika’s permissionless proof-of-stake consensus aligns with our mission to advance cutting-edge, scalable blockchain infrastructure for next-generation decentralized applications.

## **The Road Ahead: Unlocking Cross-Chain Potential**

With Ika mainnet live, developers are building a new wave of native multi-chain DeFi, wallets, and decentralized custody solutions. Developers are leveraging Ika’s breakthrough technology to create applications that enable seamless asset management, instant cross-chain transactions, and secure multi-network collaboration—ushering in a new standard for usability and scalability across Web3.

Ruby Nodes is excited to power the infrastructure securing this coordination era that finally eliminates cross-chain friction without compromising security or user control. The future of blockchain interoperability is here—and it’s powered by Ika and Ruby Nodes.
