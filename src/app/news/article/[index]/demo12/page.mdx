## **Mysten Labs and Sui: A Top-Tier Team**

Mysten Labs is the core team behind Sui, founded by ex-Facebook/Meta engineers who worked on the original Move language and Diem infrastructure. Their track record in high-performance, production-grade systems makes Sui one of the most capable and forward-looking L1s in the industry. As Ruby Nodes, being able to collaborate with Mysten Labs across multiple layers of the Sui stack is something we are genuinely proud of.

## **Sui: High-Performance L1**

Sui is a high-throughput, low-latency L1 focused on parallel execution, object-centric design, and great developer UX. It is built to power real-world applications in gaming, finance, and consumer apps without sacrificing security or decentralization.

Ruby Nodes currently operates a Sui testnet validator and actively contributes to network stability and performance, with plans to expand into mainnet validation in the near future.

## **Walrus: Decentralized Storage Where We’re Launch Partners**

Walrus is a next-generation decentralized storage network built on Sui, enabling scalable, verifiable blob storage for AI datasets, DeFi data, media, and more. It brings programmable storage primitives and data availability directly into the Sui ecosystem, opening new patterns for on-chain applications.

Ruby Nodes joined Walrus as a launch partner, running both validator and storage nodes, and helped tune the network during testnet so mainnet could launch with strong, reliable infrastructure.

## **Seal: Programmable Privacy on Sui**

Seal brings decentralized secrets management and programmable privacy to Sui using threshold encryption and on-chain access policies. Developers can build use cases like gated content, time-locked assets, private messaging, and secure team vaults without relying on centralized key managers.

Ruby Nodes operates as a genesis Seal server operator and Seal API provider, running one of the few production-grade Seal backends that applications can plug into directly – the Seal app and API gateway run on top of our infrastructure.

Visit our Seal API Gateway at [seal.rubynodes.io](https://seal.rubynodes.io) and start building privacy-first decentralized applications with confidence.

## **Sui Hypernet & SCION: Networking for Validators and Storage**

Sui Hypernet is a SCION-powered networking fabric that sits underneath Sui and Walrus nodes, providing deterministic, path-aware connectivity instead of relying purely on best-effort public internet. SCION brings path control, resilience against BGP hijacks, and multi-path routing, which significantly improves liveness and state sync for validators and storage operators.
Ruby Nodes helps operate this layer by providing Hypernet EDGE connectivity in key data centers, so operators can plug their nodes into SCION via simple GRE + FRR setups and gain more secure, low-jitter networking.

## **Our Role in the Sui Ecosystem (Including IKA)**

Ruby Nodes is not just running a single node or product—we operate across the Sui stack: Sui validation (testnet, moving toward mainnet), Walrus storage and validation, Seal server and API operations, and Hypernet/SCION connectivity for other operators.

On top of that, we also validate on IKA, the sub-second MPC network built on Sui, which acts as a coordination layer for secure multi-chain custody and interoperability. Together, this makes our involvement in the Sui ecosystem both deep and end-to-end.

## **Why This Partnership Makes Sense**

Mysten Labs is building one of the most advanced, production-ready blockchain ecosystems in the world, combining high-performance L1 design with decentralized storage, privacy, and secure networking. Ruby Nodes complements this vision by delivering reliable, specialized infrastructure across all these layers—compute, storage, networking, privacy, and MPC. The result is a tightly integrated stack where developers and users benefit from better performance, security, and UX. We are proud to be part of this journey with [Mysten Labs](https://www.mystenlabs.com/) and the broader Sui ecosystem.
