We're thrilled to be part of **Fuel's decentralized sequencer network** right from the launch. This marks our first **L2 mainnet sequencer**, a major milestone for Ruby Nodes as we continue to expand our **infrastructure expertise**.

## **Fuel Network: The Future of Ethereum Scaling**
Fuel Network is a **high-performance Ethereum Layer 2 solution**, designed to enhance **transaction speed, lower costs, and maintain decentralization**. Powered by **FuelVM** and leveraging **parallel execution**, Fuel achieves an incredible **21,000 transactions per second (TPS) per CPU-core**, making it one of the most scalable rollups available today.

Recently, Fuel has taken a major step toward full decentralization by **opening staking and delegation** for its sequencer network on both **Fuel Ignition & Ethereum**. Validators play a critical role in sequencing transactions and securing the network, with Fuel using Tendermint’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus to ensure efficiency and fairness.

The network currently has **32 validators** on Fuel, but only the original **11 validators** accept **native FUEL staking** directly on the Fuel network. The remaining validators, including these 11, can only enable staking via the **Ethereum network**.

## **Ruby Nodes: Supporting Fuel as a Validator, Sequencer on Ethereum & RPC Node Provider**
Ruby Nodes is proud to contribute to **Fuel’s growing validator ecosystem** by operating both a **sequencer and a validator**. Our role is crucial in securing **Fuel’s rollups** and processing transactions efficiently.

In addition to our **sequencer**, we also provide **two RPC nodes**, reinforcing **network reliability and accessibility**.

## **Staking with Ruby Nodes**
Users can **delegate their FUEL tokens** to trusted validators like **Ruby Nodes** to earn rewards. Currently, staking with Ruby Nodes offers an attractive **~39% APY**, making it one of the most competitive options for those looking to participate in **Fuel’s decentralized ecosystem**.

To stake with us, just follow this link: **[Fuel Staking on Ethereum](https://app.fuel.network/staking/on-ethereum)**

## **How to Stake on Fuel Network**
- **On Ethereum**: Users can connect their **Ethereum-compatible wallet**, migrate FUEL tokens if needed, and manually select a **validator**. Staking rewards accumulate automatically, and unstaking follows a Tendermint PoS unbonding period of up to two weeks.
- **On Fuel Ignition**: Staking is seamless, supporting **EVM, SVM, and native Fuel wallets**. Users can **delegate FUEL tokens** easily via this [link](https://app.fuel.network/staking/on-fuel), claim rewards, and unstake at any time with at least one week passing since the last deposit.

## **Fuel’s Commitment to Decentralization**
Unlike many L2 solutions that rely on **centralized sequencing**, Fuel is building a **permissionless validator network** to improve fault tolerance, liveness, and censorship resistance. Its **modular design** separates execution from consensus, preventing unnecessary centralization while optimizing **scalability and transaction throughput**.

## **A Milestone Partnership**
By operating a **sequencer, validator, and RPC nodes** on **Fuel’s network**, Ruby Nodes strengthens the infrastructure supporting one of Ethereum’s most advanced rollups. With our **multi-continent hardware** and **expertise in blockchain infrastructure**, we are excited to contribute to **Fuel’s long-term vision** of a **fast, decentralized, and scalable Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem**.
