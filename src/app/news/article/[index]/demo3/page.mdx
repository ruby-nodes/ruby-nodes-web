};

Ruby Nodes is proud to be a key partner in advancing **Avail’s innovative blockchain infrastructure**. From supporting the testnet phase to operating RPC endpoints, we’ve worked closely with Avail to bring their vision of scalable, interoperable modular execution to life.

**Collaboration with Avail**
    • **Testnet Phase Contribution**: Ruby Nodes played an active role during Avail’s Goldberg Testnet phase, participating in the incentivized **Clash of Nodes campaign**. This phase was essential in testing Avail's capacity to act as a foundational layer for rollup-centric ecosystems.
    • **Launch Partners**: As a launch partner, we deployed our **Ruby Nodes validator**, ensuring network reliability and contributing to the decentralized infrastructure Avail relies on.
    • **Running RPCs for Avail**: Ruby Nodes operates an RPC endpoint for Avail, providing efficient and reliable network access. Check it out here: [Avail RPC by Ruby Nodes](https://explorer.avail.so/?rpc=wss%253A%252F%252Favail-rpc.rubynodes.io#/accounts).

**About Avail**

Avail is redefining blockchain scalability and interoperability through its modular infrastructure layer. By employing data availability sampling (DAS), zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-rollups), and KZG polynomial commitments, Avail ensures seamless chain interactions and cross-rollup settlements. Its three core components—Avail Nexus, Avail DA, and Avail Fusion—work in harmony to provide:
    • **Enhanced Scalability**: Avail’s DA offloads data storage, allowing blockchains to process significantly more transactions.
    • **Cross-Ecosystem Interoperability**: Through Nexus, Avail enables smooth coordination between rollups and blockchains.
    • **Robust Security**: Decentralized data storage, coupled with Fusion’s pooled crypto-economic security, ensures resilience and reliability.
    • **Blockchain Agnosticism**: Avail supports both EVM and non-EVM environments, making it highly versatile for developers.

**Looking Ahead**
Our partnership with Avail reflects our commitment to supporting cutting-edge blockchain solutions that drive Web3 forward. Ruby Nodes is excited to continue contributing to Avail’s mission to unify blockchain ecosystems and enhance the scalability and efficiency of decentralized applications.
Whether through infrastructure support, validator services, or operating RPCs, Ruby Nodes is dedicated to ensuring that Avail becomes the backbone of modular Web3 innovation.
