Recently, the 0G Labs team successfully launched the Aristotle Mainnet, marking a major milestone in the world’s first decentralized AI operating system (dAIOS).

Ruby Nodes has been part of this journey from the testnet phase, serving as a validator, RPC nodes provider, and decentralized storage and data availability (DA) provider.

Now, as the network runs in full production, Ruby Nodes continues supporting 0G by operating validator nodes and running alignment nodes.

## **Ruby Nodes’ Role in 0G**

Ruby Nodes helped stabilize the network during the testnet phase with robust validator and RPC infrastructure, as well as decentralized storage and data availability services that underpin 0G’s AI data workflows.

Now live on mainnet, Ruby Nodes runs validator nodes ensuring network security and decentralization, as well as alignment nodes critical for consensus and agent coordination across the ecosystem.

## **Why Choose 0G?**

**• Lightning-fast transactions:** Unlocking AI-powered applications with throughput and speed that open new possibilities.

**• Optimized for on-chain AI:** Specialized support for storing large inference traces and enabling complex AI computations on-chain.

**• Cost-efficient:** Costs for storage and retrieval are drastically reduced, opening AI to a broader market.

**• Fully customizable:** Token and storage parameters can be tailored across multiple chains and rollups.

## **0G Layers: Modular Foundations for Decentralized AI**

0G is engineered with a layered and modular architecture, making it unique among decentralized AI protocols. Each layer is designed to handle a specialized role and scales independently, yet they all work seamlessly together to form one high-performance AI-native platform.

**Consensus Layer:**
Handles fast, secure transaction ordering and validator coordination for the network.

**Storage Layer:**
Decentralized, AI-optimized storage holds models, datasets, and outputs with low cost and high reliability.

**Data Availability (DA) Layer:**
Ensures all critical AI data is published, accessible, and verifiable across the network.

**Compute Layer:**
Executes AI inference and model training in a decentralized, trustless environment.

**Alignment Nodes:**
Coordinate and audit agent behavior, enforcing AI integrity and compliance on-chain.

## **Real-World Applications**

**• Gaming:** Securely manages game metadata and cryptographic proofs for fair, transparent in-game transactions.

**• DeFi:** Enables fast, reliable settlements, improving operational efficiency across decentralized finance.

**• AI Workloads:** Supports on-chain AI inference and real-time processing of large data sets, overcoming bottlenecks of traditional systems.

**• Cross-Layer Partnerships:** Collaborations with L2 ecosystems like Arbitrum and Optimism boost data availability and storage scalability.Looking Ahead

**With Aristotle Mainnet live and backed by a vibrant coalition of over 100 partners, 0G is laying the foundation for an open, unstoppable AI economy.**

**Ruby Nodes is proud to support this technology that blends decentralized computation, data availability, and storage into a new paradigm for AI development and deployment.**
