It was in the year 2020 when we, Petr & Pavel, were invited to a pub quiz by our friend Marek. We didn't know each other, but Marek put us in a team to compete with other nerds and newbies. And guess what? We won! And the prize was a bottle of Kraken rum (not the exchange, but...) :-) .

Fueled by lively crypto discussions and after a friendly clinking of glasses, we decided to try some things together. Our initial focus was on creating content and fostering a local crypto community. But as our ambitions grew, we identified a crucial gap in the market - a reliable source of robust node infrastructure. Well, that's for now, but you can imagine the beginnings, where we just tried what we could.

That was the start of a new chapter. We saw the potential of Polkadot, a cutting-edge blockchain platform, and knew it could be the cornerstone of our infrastructure business. We started by using cloud providers, but it soon became clear that for ultimate efficiency and control, we needed to take matters into our own hands. That's where our different skill sets came into play. With Petr's deep expertise in backend development, we meticulously built and optimized our own bare-metal server setup. This dedication to maximizing efficiency paid off handsomely, and we quickly established ourselves as one of the providers of the Polkadot ecosystem under the name Polkadotters.

But our story doesn't end there. While Polkadot provided a solid foundation, our adventurous spirit drove us to explore further. We couldn't resist the path of exploration, so we're pushing the boundaries in other blockchains. Cosmos, Cardano, Fantom, EVM chains, L2s, bridges, that's what we were curious about. To do that, we needed a rebrand that reflected what we wanted to do, to expand into other ecosystems beyond Polkadot. And that is where Ruby Nodes was born. Ruby toughness, node precision.

By offering our robust node infrastructure and operations services across multiple chains, we aim to provide developers and projects with the tools they need to thrive in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape. The journey continues, and we invite you to join us as we navigate the exciting frontiers of the blockchain world.
