The blockchain space is evolving fast, but a crucial piece has long been missing—truly flexible, programmable privacy and decentralized secrets management. Now with the launch of Seal mainnet on Sui, this gap is closing, and Ruby Nodes is honored to be an active Seal server operator, supporting this revolutionary step forward.

Seal ushers in a new era where privacy, access control, and data sharing become fully programmable, governed on-chain by transparent smart contracts. Powered by a decentralized network of key servers—including Ruby Nodes—Seal leverages threshold encryption to keep data secure without centralized intermediaries. This ensures decryption keys are released only according to strict, on-chain policies, eliminating single points of failure or trust.

## **Why Seal Matters on Sui**

Sui’s programmable, scalable blockchain forms the perfect foundation for Seal’s decentralized secrets management. Seal integrates seamlessly with decentralized storage like Walrus to enable secure, private handling of encrypted assets, NFTs, and content—empowering developers to build privacy-first applications ranging from gated content and time-locked auctions to private messaging and team data vaults.

## **Ruby Nodes and the Seal API Gateway**

To unlock the full potential of Seal, Ruby Nodes operates the Seal API Gateway—a secure, reliable, global infrastructure service that simplifies access to Seal’s threshold encryption and policy enforcement. The gateway delivers 99.9% uptime, low latency via edge distribution, and straightforward subscription-based usage, empowering developers and enterprises to integrate cutting-edge privacy effortlessly.

The gateway’s robust analytics and transparent billing round out a plug-and-play solution for bringing decentralized access control and privacy-preserving workflows to production-ready Web3 applications.

## **Looking Ahead with Seal**

Seal’s launch signals a paradigm shift for Web3 privacy, replacing fragmented solutions and centralized key managers with a truly decentralized, programmable framework. With Ruby Nodes as a critical part of the decentralized key server network, developers and users worldwide can finally enjoy enhanced data privacy, flexible access models, and on-chain governance—all without sacrificing usability or security.
