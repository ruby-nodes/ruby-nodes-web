      question: "What is staking?",
      answer:
        "Staking is a process of locking your tokens (be it ADA, DOT or FTM) and receiving rewards for doing so. At the same time, staking boost the security of the underlying network.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do Ruby Nodes take any custody of user's funds?",
      answer:
        "No, all of our service are fully non-custodial and we can't touch delegator's funds at any point of time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why should you trust Ruby Nodes as a node operator?",
      answer:
        "We started in as early as 2020 in the Polkadot ecosystem - since then we have built a huge community, became validators on almost all parachains and joined various validator DAOs. Since then, we have expanded to other ecosystems like Ethereum, Cardano or Fantom. This is what we love and we are here to stay!",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure a quality of your service?",
      answer:
        "We run all the validators on the best hardware possible, we also employ backups and strict monitoring that ensures maximum uptime. Ruby Nodes also optimize heavily for performance, therefore you will usually find us among the nodes with highest APR.",
    },
    {
      question: "What do you do with the staking rewards?",
      answer:
        "We heavily invest into the community activities like organizing conferences, publishing educational articles or promoting the cryptocurrency world. We believe that validators are a firm part of crypto community and we should do our best to help the projects we operate on to thrive!",
    },
    {
      question: "Why should you support Ruby Nodes as a validator?",
      answer:
        "On one hand, we bring the high-quality of service together with one of the highest APR on our validators in the ecosystem. On the other, you will also help to decentralize projects we support and their ecocystem by supporting a community validator - which, in turn, will support the ecosystem itself. We are proud to support Polkadot and other ecosystems from the early days and we definitely want to give something back in return.",

      We run on AMD EPYC 9554 64-core machines with 512 GB of RAM 4x 3.84 NVMe SSD drives.
